Well, I didn't quite finish in time. It's actually a matter of a half hour... I feel pretty ready to just totally wing the presentation.
On one hand I'm pissed that now I have to drop this class as well -- It's been a huge waste of time this semester.
At least, as with linear algebra, I did actually do a lot of work. In the case of math, I SHOULD be able to pull through with an A this time if I actually do homework and proofs and stuff.
For this public speaking crap, I can basically just take the same professor again next time and just do a more polished version of this speech. At least I can get the work up to my own standards before turning it in...

There's really just no way around it though... this fucking sucks.
