\begin{itemize}
\item Arguing on Planet Earth: 
	\begin{itemize}
	\item I liked the first section beause of its emphasis on thinking and reflection, but also enjoyed the turn to formal analysis. It also suggests to find oneself before one takes on the aspects of others.
	\item I suggest that you revise some of the pictures in APE. Some of them are good, like the Teaparty and the risky penguin to poke, but remember that while you're talking about stuff, many are staring at whatever pictures you put on the page. If you have space, any samples for the writing assignments that could be included would be ideal, so that we don't necessarily have to look at it online. I also suggest including a little bit on proposals, since I had to go online looking and all of that information was geared towards thesis/grad research proposals. (See post in general forum)
	\end{itemize}

\item Reading Course Pack: 
	\begin{itemize}
	\item I particularly enjoyed \emph{The Lowest Animal}, \emph{The Tragedy of the Commons}, and the \emph{How Many Sheep Will It Hold?} essay.
	\item I like classics better than contemporary pieces, espescially when a lot of time is going to be spent on it. It's one thing to be analyzing an argument, but it's always better beautiful. (And contemporary writing, espescially the newspaper opinion pieces, are very square.) 
	\end{itemize}

\item Blackboard Discussion Posts: 
	\begin{itemize}
	\item The Argument in Art post was the most valuable, because it was directly related to another assignment.
	\item The posts are valuable for learning but it's hard to have a meaningful conversation with your peers online when the alternative of real-life discussion is only days away. 
	\end{itemize}

\item Peer Reviews: 
	\begin{itemize}
	\item One useful aspect of peer reviews is the pressure to have something written. In addition to this deadline, input from others on wording, pace, and other aspects of the paper are always welome. Finally, it's useful to read the papers of others to get ideas about your own.
	\item Having two peer review sessions was nice, although it definetely cuts into classtime. Maybe instead of one long session, you can have two short ones, so people can read and be read by more peers \& their papers. (Espescially since I personally had read and discussed my group's papers in easily half the alloted time.)
	\end{itemize}

\item In General: 
	\begin{itemize}
	\item I enjoyed the course, even though I tend to dislike English classes. I'm not big on poetry, but after reading some, I have a bit of a better appreciation, at least. I think that the objectives of the course, in terms of cultivating writing skills and critical thinking were met.
	\item I feel like I will take away a stronger apprecation for poetry, and a better idea of fallacious arguments and rhetoric. I don't feel like my worldview has been moved forward during this course beyond its initial articulation, but it has been a short time.
	\item
