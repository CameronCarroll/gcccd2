currently branches use windows xp desktops using older version of software. not compatible with new version
14 regional sales offices, one warehouse one corporate office. (LA for warehouse/corporate)

branches don't communicate amongst themselves

eacn branch:
1 manager, administrative assistant, oversees:
	sales: 
	2 salespeople	uses pr department, sapreadsheets, connectiont to corporate office, database, local client data is at branch
	sometimes contracted outside sales force
	sales desk, connection to warehouse to order stuff

	accounting:
	2 clers manage accounting system, use spreadsheet/accounting system

	personnael:
	one clerk maintinas records using database, but all records are held at corporate office. timesheets are transmitted up every friday using spreadsheet

	administration:
	ranch manager, adaministrative assistant, one intern



considerations for ugprade:
1. security (omg use a vpn)
2. backup & control -> network OS
3. application standardization, control -> netowkr OS
4. offer website for purchases etc, collected data
5. increased sharing but good security still


so what you need to do:
1. design an office plan
2. Decide on components for network... they need a network OS, a way of networking everybody together into 1-2 CDs, a VPN to connect to corporate/warehouse
3. Design topology, create diagram
4. Figure out costs, create spreadsheet
5. create proposal
6. omg really is there enough time for this bullshit?
