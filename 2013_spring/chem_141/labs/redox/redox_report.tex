\section*{Discussion}
The only part of the activity series which I had some difficulty with was determining the place of the iron (iii) ion. There didn't appear to be enough information to place it in the series, as I could only say that it was more active than iodine. In order to determine its location I would propose doing a reaction between iron (iii) and hydrogen, perhaps by mixing an iron (iii) solution with an acid. I would also do an upper-bound check by reacting the iron (iii) ion with zinc dust and seeing whether zinc became oxidized.

\section*{Conclusion}
\paragraph{Activity Series:}
\begin{enumerate}
\item Zn \\[-0.5cm]
\item Fe \\[-0.5cm]
\item \ce{Fe^{3+}} ? \\[-0.5cm]
\item H \\[-0.5cm]
\item Cu \\[-0.5cm]
\item I \\[-0.5cm]
\item Br \\[-0.5cm]
\end{enumerate}
